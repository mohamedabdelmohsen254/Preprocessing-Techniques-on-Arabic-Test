# Preprocessing-Techniques-on-Arabic-Test
Data pre-processing is important to minimize the noise and get a better classification accuracy and we applied a lot of techniques in preprocessing the Arabic text such as removing stop words, non-Arabic letters and spaces, Diacritics, Punctuation, Links, mentions, retweet indicators and suffixes and prefixes also, we reduced the Arabic words to their roots using different stemmers and we handled emojis and emoticons in the data in different ways

The Arabic language is now facing many problems due to the increase in verb conjugations, the formation, and the presence of more than one word that leads to the same meaning, and many other problems that we should put into considerations when we work in Arabic text.

The dataset was collected by a research group at Nile University (NU). It is a balanced dataset consists of 10,065 Arabic tweets mostly using Egyptian dialect, and was manually annotated using eight emotions (sadness, anger, joy, surprise, love, sympathy, fear and none). It was collected using the” Olympics” hashtags from Egypt in the period between Jul 2016 and Aug 2016.
